## Real-Time Communication System Powered by AI for Specially Abled
We have developed an automatic sign language recognition system with the help of image processing and computer vision techniques. To use natural image sequences, without the signer having to wear data gloves or colored gloves, and to be able to recognize many signs. The motivation for this work is to provide a real time interface so that signers can easily and quickly communicate with non-signers. To efficiently and accurately recognize signed words, using a minimal number of training examples.
